# PHP-travel-blog
A travel blog made in PHP and Bootstrap I created back in early 2023. Start Bootstrap - Blog Home v5.0.8 (https://startbootstrap.com/template/blog-home) was used as the base site template. No PHP frameworks were used. Made using an MVC pattern. The application uses MySQL server for storing data.
### Project Description
A site containing travel blog with posts. Users can create an account, log in, edit their data or delete an account. Logged users can add new post, edit or delete posts created by them. Accounts with an admin role can manage any post.
### Installation
1. Launch MySQL server (I used XAMPP MySQL database).
2. Execute SQL commands from _database.sql_ file into database.
3. Put _travel-blog_ folder on HTML server (I used XAMPP).
### Sample data
Sample data consisting of posts, user accounts and photos were added to the project. The table below includes nicknames and passwords of sample accounts.

| Nickname | Password     |
|----------|--------------|
